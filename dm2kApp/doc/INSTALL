Installation
************

This distribution of dm2k should install in various versions of
epics-application-development-environments. As it is only tested with the
current version of our development-environment (makeBaseApp.pl, using
"Makefile.Host", not "Makefile.Unix"), minor changes may have to be applied
to the makefiles.

#### that the Makefile/config-file structures that use "Makefile.Unix"  ####
#### to build the host-side applications are no longer supported!       ####
#### Although I try to keep the "Makefile.Unix" up to date, it may not  ####
#### do what you'd expect...                                            ####

So you may untar the distributed archive in either

   * the directory where all the EPICS-extensions are located
     (sth. like <...>/extensions/src/)

or * in a toplevel-directory populated with a config-directory,
     a Makefile... by "makeBaseApp.pl"

What the supplied configuration should do if you run 'make' in the
top-directory (.../dm2k-2.5.2/) is the following:

   a. build the utility-libraries in the following order

        graphX graphX/printUtils xc libUnix jpt

      jpt is only built if XRT/graph isn't available (see "Cartesian Plot")

   b. then build the main application in

        dm2k

##### Variables to control build of dm2k
### 
### CDEV                if this variable is set, it should point to the
###                     installation directory of the cdev-distribution
###   CDEVSHLIB         setting this variable is implied by setting
###                     CDEV. It should point to the directory where 
###                     the cdev-library is to be found.
### 
### XRTGRAPH            holds the directory of the XRT/graph installation.
###                     If this variable is set, dm2k is built with
###                     XRT/graph support instead of JPT.
###
### DM2K_HELP_PATH      Is the stem of the URL that holds the
###                     dm2k-documentation (default is
###                     http://help.bessy.de/Dm2k).
###
### STATIC_BUILD        controls whether to build dm2k statically or with
###                     shared libraries. The default setting is somewhere
###                     in your local/global config-directory.
###
### XPM_INC, XPM_LIB    The existence of teh variable XPM_INC forces
###                     compilation of dm2k with xpm-support. In this case,
###                     XPM_INC should point to the directory where the
###                     file xpm.h (or X11/xpm.h) is located while XPM_LIB
###                     points to the directory of the file libXpm.(a|sl|so)
###
### PURIFY              To debug dm2k with purify, set this variable to the
###                     command-name to prepend to the linker-call
###                     (e.g. "purify"). Setting PURIFY automatically sets
###                     STATIC_BUILD to YES!
###
### The name of the produced binary is constructed the following way.
###
###     + The stem is always "dm2k"
###     + if dm2k is built with cdev-support, "_cdev" is appended
###     + if dm2k is built statically, ".static" is appended
###     + if dm2k is to be debugged with purify ".pure" is appended


Fonts
=====

The directory .../dm2k-2.5.2/dm2k/fonts.alias/ contains some sample
fonts.alias files for several platforms. To test, which one looks best with
your X-Server, please rename/copy one of the files to 'fonts.alias', call
the program 'mkfontdir' in this directory add the path to this file to the
fontpath.

    e.g.:

      > cd <wherever-it-is>/dm2k-2.5.2/dm2k/fonts.alias
      > cp fonts.alias.hp fonts.alias
      > mkfontdir
      > xset +fp `pwd`

If you find a proper fonts.alias for your installation, you should install
it globally for all dm2k-users. This can be done by either appending it to
an existing fonts.alias-file in an existing and used font-path or by adding 
the dm2k-fonts.alias-directory to the font-path permanently.

Cartesian Plot
==============

If the variable XRTGRAPH is set in the global configuration, the commercial 
XRT/graph-widget will be used for cartesian plots. This may change in the
future, because dm2k brings its own version of a cartesian plot widget (Jpt).

Jpt (Jefferson Lab Plotting Toolkit) was developed as a plug-in-replacement 
for the XRT/graph widget by Ge Lei <leige@jlab.org> at JLab. It supports
all features, dm2k uses of the XRT-widget.

Even if you have the XRT/graph widget installed, you can build dm2k with
the Jpt widget by giving make the extra argument XRTGRAPH=


Xpm-support
===========

Xpm-support has been removed from the dm2k-source-code. It was only used to 
implement a colorful startup-logo and colour-desktop-icons for the
window-manager. Dm2k now uses a system-supplied Xpm-library if you want
these colourful icons. The location of include-files and library-files has
to be given on the command-line of make (make XPM_INC=... XPM_LIB=...).


Summary of build-options
========================

The following options may be given to the make-command on the command-line.

      XRTGRAPH=				builds without XRT/graph widget
					although it is installed.
					dm2k uses the supplied Jpt-library
					instead.

      XPM_INC=... XPM_LIB=...           builds with Xpm-library for fancy
					logos/icons.

If you set your preferred default configuration in the global
config/CONFIG_SITE... files properly, you of course don't have to set these 
options on the command-line.

Please report any build-problems to Thomas.Birke@mail.bessy.de.


Using dm2k
==========

Dm2k tries to behave just like medm did/does.

One major difference is, that most environment-variables have the MEDM-part 
replaced by DM2K. This enables you to have two different setups for
testing.

By renaming/sym-linking dm2k to medm you can force dm2k to use the same
environment-variables medm does.

The macros DISPLAY, HOST and USER are set by default, but can be
overwritten.

    DISPLAY  contains a modified copy of the display-variable, dots (.) and 
             colons (:) are substituted by underscores (_). fully or
             partially qualified or completely missing hostnames are
             substituted by the unqualified lowercase  hostname.

              :0                       -> snow_0_0   assuming localhost is snow
              snow.acc.bessy.de:0.0    -> snow_0_0
              SNOW:0.0                 -> snow_0_0

    HOST     is the unqualified local hostname

    USER     is the name of the userid dm2k runs under (taken from
             environment)
