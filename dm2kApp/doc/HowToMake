##### Variables to control building of dm2k
### 
### CDEV		if this variable is set, it should point to the
###			installation directory of the cdev-distribution
###   CDEVSHLIB		setting this variable is implied by setting
###			CDEV. It should point to the directory where 
###			the cdev-library is to be found.
### 
### XRTGRAPH		holds the directory of the XRT/graph installation.
###			If this variable is set, dm2k is built with
###			XRT/graph support instead of JPT.
###
### DM2K_HELP_PATH	Is the stem of the URL that holds the
###			dm2k-documentation (default is
###			http://help.bessy.de/Dm2k).
###
### STATIC_BUILD	controls whether to build dm2k statically or with
### 			shared libraries. The default setting is somewhere
### 			in your local/global config-directory.
###
### XPM_INC, XPM_LIB	The existence of teh variable XPM_INC forces
###			compilation of dm2k with xpm-support. In this case,
###			XPM_INC should point to the directory where the
###			file xpm.h (or X11/xpm.h) is located while XPM_LIB
###			points to the directory of the file libXpm.(a|sl|so)
###
### PURIFY		To debug dm2k with purify, set this variable to the
###			command-name to prepend to the linker-call
###			(e.g. "purify"). Setting PURIFY automatically sets
###			STATIC_BUILD to YES!
###
### The name of the produced binary is constructed teh following way.
###
### 	+ The stem is always "dm2k"
###	+ if dm2k is built with cdev-support, "_cdev" is appended
###	+ if dm2k is built statically, ".static" is appended
###	+ if dm2k is to be debugged with purify ".pure" is appended
