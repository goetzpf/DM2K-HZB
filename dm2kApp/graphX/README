ENHANCEMENTS:
------------
15 June 1991 - Interactive Pan/Zoom

Interaction (pan and zoom) is now supported for the 1 and 2D plot types
(seql and graph plots).  Clicking (MB1) and rubber-banding a rectangle
in the data area of these plots will zoom the plot into the specified
region of interest.  To unzoom, click (MB1) outside the data area (by the
title, or outside the axes anywhere, for instance).  This functionality
is added via  seqlSetInteractive(seql,TRUE) or graphSetInteractive(graph,TRUE)
calls.  See the testGraphX/testGraph.c or testGraphX/testSeql.c example
programs...



INSTALLATION:
------------

(Note:  all of the below locations are relative to the top (graphX) directory)

To build the base (X11 and Xt only) graphX libraries, enter  "make X11".
The graphX.a and printUtils.a libraries will be built.
## for our friends at LANL/GTA and ANL/APS - do a "make epics"
------------ users of fdmgr should now do a -DEPICS rather than -DGTA

To build the Motif-based graphApp layer and test programs in addition to
the above, enter "make all".

To clean out objects, executables and libraries, enter "make clean".


These Makefiles presume fairly standard placement of includes and libraries.  
When a make fails, it is probably due to problems related to the location 
of the widget set and X includes and libraries.  At this point, editing
the offending Makefile is the only recourse.  These Makefiles are fairly 
straight-forward and should pose no particular problem in straightening out
for specific installations.
