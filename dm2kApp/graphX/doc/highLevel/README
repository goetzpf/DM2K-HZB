			graphApp documentation
			----------------------


The documentation for the graphX library is located in this directory
in TeX/LATeX format, using psfig for incorporation of PostScript, and
dvi2ps for the generation of the PostScript output document.

Print the file  graphApp.ps  out on a suitable PostScript printer.  Rarely
should there be any need to work with the TeX sources.
