			graphX documentation
			-------------------


The documentation for the graphX library is located in this directory
in TeX/LATeX format, using psfig for incorporation of PostScript, and
dvi2ps for the generation of the PostScript output document.

Print the file  graphX.ps  out on a suitable PostScript printer.  Rarely
should there be any need to work with the TeX sources.

For small memory printers, explicit font-flushing can be done in the
output PostScript files.... (I'll figure out what that means later)
