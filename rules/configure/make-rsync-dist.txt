New distribution system
***********************

The new distribution system is based on Götz Pfeiffers script (rsync-dist.pl: http://www-csr.bessy.de/control/Soft/bii_scripts/scripts/rsync-dist.html).

The central ideas are:

- each distribution is immutable
- new distributions must be activated explicitly per user agent (e.g. IOC)
  before it can have any effect

Distribution Domains
--------------------

Just as in the old distribution system ('make rdist', etc), 
there are three separate distribution domains:

- IOC: distributes 'bin', 'db', 'dbd', and 'iocBoot',
- OPI: distributes 'dl' and 'etc',
- DOC: distributes 'doc'.

The generated subdirectories 'share' and 'lib' will not be distributed.

Configuration Files
-------------------

Each distribution domain has a configuration file named

  rsync-dist.<domain>.config

which contains the following definitions:

- RSYNC_DIST_HOST: a list of username@hostname
- RSYNC_DIST_PATH: path where distributed versions are stored
- RSYNC_DIST_LINKPATH: path where symbolic links (named versions) lie
- RSYNC_DIST_LOCALPATH: list of (local) directories to distribute
- RSYNC_DIST_EDITOR_NO_DEFAULTS: start editor w/o defaults (1=true or 0=false)
- RSYNC_DIST_MESSAGE: default log message
- RSYNC_DIST_TAG: default tag

Make Variables
--------------

Distributing and activating versions can be controlled through make variables.
The following variables can be set on the command line. They generally take
precedence over (i.e. replace) corresponding options in the config file.

Variables for all targets
.........................

- RSYNC_DIST_OPTS: an arbitrary list of options that will be given to the
  rsync-dist.pl command (in addition to the pre-defined options).
- HOSTS, HOSTS_<domain>: a list of remote hosts in username@hostname
  notation. HOSTS_<domain> affects only one domain, HOSTS affects all 'domains'.

Variables for specific targets
..............................

- (anchor:#VERSION)VERSION: A single word naming a distributed version (in date/time notation,
  see rsync-dist.pl documentation). If not defined or empty, the latest version
  distributed by the current user for the given domain is used.
  Only useful for targets (add-names:#add-names)
  and (activate-version:#activate-version).
- (anchor:#NAMES)NAMES: The symbolic names for which the given version should be activated.
  The symbolic names must be created using 'add-names' before they can be
  activated (however, creating a symbolic name for a version also activates
  this version).
  Only useful for targets (add-names:#add-names)
  and (activate-version:#activate-version).
- (anchor:#FILES)FILES, FILES_<domain>: a list of file and/or directory names.
  As with the HOSTS* variables, FILES_<domain> affects only one domain,
  FILES affects all domains. The effect is that the distribution will be
  'partial', i.e.  only  the files
  explicitly listed will be distributed, other files and directories will be
  left as in the last version.
  Only useful for target (rsync-dist:#rsync-dist).

Targets
-------

The make targets as listed below affect all distribution domains simultaneously.
For each target xxx listed, there exists a corresponding target xxx.IOC,
xxx.OPI, and xxx.DOC which affects only the distribution domain specified by the
target's suffix.

There are five new top-level make targets:

- (rsync-dist:#rsync-dist)
- (add-names:#add-names)
- (activate-version:#activate-version)
- (deprecate-version:#deprecate-version)
- (list-all-versions:#list-all-versions)
- (list-active-versions:#list-active-versions)
- (unlock:#unlock)
- (force-unlock:#force-unlock)

(anchor:#rsync-dist)

rsync-dist
..........

Distribute files. This automatically creates a new version with a name
consisting of date and time. Extra make
variables affecting this target: (FILES, FILES_<domain>:#FILES).

add-names
.........

Create symbolic names for a certain version. Extra make
variables affecting this target are (VERSION:#VERSION) and (NAMES:#NAMES).

(anchor:#activate-version)

activate-version
................

Activate a version for a certain number of target names. Extra make variables
affecting this target are (VERSION:#VERSION) and (NAMES:#NAMES). Symbolic names
such as specified using the variable NAMES must be created using 'add-names'
before they can be activated (however, creating a symbolic name for a version
also activates this version).

(anchor:#deprecate-version)

deprecate-version
.................

Deprecate a version. Extra make variable affecting this target is VERSION.

(anchor:#list-all-versions)

list-all-versions
.................

List all existing versions.

(anchor:#list-active-versions)

list-active-versions
....................

List all active versions, together with the names (e.g. IOCs) for which the
version is the active one.

(anchor:#unlock)

unlock
......

Remove all lock files associated with your user name; preserves lock files of
other users.

(anchor:#force-unlock)

force-unlock
............

Remove all lock files, regardless of owner.

*  ATTENTION  : This will break rsync-dist actions of other users!
